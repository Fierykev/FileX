USER CONTROLS:

Left and Right Arrow Keys:

Rotate the camera left and right respectively.

Up and Down:

Move forward and backwards in the direction the camera is facing.

TAB:

Change to wireframe mode.

R:

Switch render types (moves to next mode and wraps around):

1). Default mode with ambient occlusion, bump mapping, normals, and texture planar projection.

2). Ambient occlusion.

3). Normals with bump mapping.

4). Texture planar projection.

T:

Switch between worlds (moves to next world and wraps around):

1). Shelf Demo

2). Planet Demo

3). Noise Combination Demo

4). Unstable World Demo

UNDERNEATH THE HOOD:

Stages of Procedural Generation:

1). Evaluate the density function.
	- Density*.hlsl

2). Find areas where terrain is present (density function transitions from + to - value).
	- Occupied*.hlsl
	
3). Remove duplicate vertices by only caring about those on edges 0, 3, and 8.
	- GenVerts*.hlsl

4). Clear the 3D texture for indices.
	- ClearTex*.hlsl
	
5). Perform a vertex splat to determine index ID numbers.
	- VertSplat*.hlsl
	
6). Generate indices based on the results from the vertex splat.
	- GenIndices*.hlsl

7). Create the vertices and store them in a buffer for usage during the draw phase.
	- VertexMesh*.hlsl
	
NOTE: DensityH.hlsl contains the density function code.
