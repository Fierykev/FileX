To run the demo, a computer with a graphics card compatible with D3DX12 is needed.  Launch FileX/FileX.exe for the demo to run.

The project was built with Visual Sutdio 2015 using D3DX12, DevIL, and a C port of OpenSimplex (https://github.com/smcameron/open-simplex-noise-in-c).
The method of procedural generation is based on that discussed in GPU Gems 3.
